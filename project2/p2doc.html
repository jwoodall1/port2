Find The Ball - Dog Game
The Find The Ball game is an interactive web-based game built with p5.js. In this game, you help a playful dog find its tennis ball in a room filled with interactive zones.

Features
Dynamic Start Screen:
- The game begins with a welcome screen that introduces the game and displays the rules.
- A start button lets you begin the gameplay.

Interactive Room:
- A room image serves as the backdrop for the game.
- Multiple interactive zones (e.g., Left Sofa, TV, Right Sofa, Coffee Table, Lamp, Window) are defined.
- Hovering over a zone highlights it, and clicking within these zones increases an "Oopsies" counter.

Ball Interaction:
- A tennis ball is randomly placed in the room.
- Clicking on the ball results in a win if the Oopsies counter is below a threshold; otherwise, it results in a loss.

Game States:
- The game includes several states: "start" (welcome screen), "game" (active gameplay), and "over" (game over screen).
- A restart option is provided on the game over screen.

Responsive Design:
- The canvas dynamically scales to fit the browser window.
- Virtual coordinates are used to ensure consistent gameplay across various screen sizes.

File Structure
index.html:
- The main HTML file containing markup, styles, and the p5.js sketch.
sketch.js:
- The JavaScript file that implements game logic, including image loading, state management, and user interactions.
Assets:
- room.jpg, dog.jpg, tennisball.png: Image assets used in the game.

How It Works
- The game utilizes p5.js to render a scalable canvas.
- Interactive zones are defined in virtual coordinates and highlighted on mouse hover.
- Game logic tracks user actions, updating the "Oopsies" score and managing win/lose conditions.
- A dog image is persistently displayed in the bottom-left corner.
- Clicking the ball, if done with minimal damage, results in a win; otherwise, the game ends with a loss.

Usage
- Open the game in a modern web browser.
- Click the "Start" button to begin.
- Interact with various room zones and try to find the ball.
- Click the ball when found to either win (if few Oopsies) or lose (if too many Oopsies).
