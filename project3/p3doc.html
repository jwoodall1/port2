Coin Drop - Hand Tracking Game
--------------------------------
Coin Drop is an interactive web-based game that leverages hand tracking with ml5.js to deliver an engaging, immersive experience.
In this game, players control a virtual bucket using their index finger (detected via webcam) to catch falling coins while avoiding bombs.

Features:
-----------
• Hand Pose Detection:
  - Utilizes ml5.js's handPose model to track the player's index finger.
  - The detected finger controls a virtual bucket represented by an image.

• Falling Objects:
  - Coins and bombs drop from the top of the screen at varying speeds.
  - Catching coins increases your score; colliding with a bomb results in an immediate game over.

• Game States:
  - Multiple states include: "start" (welcome screen), "countdown", "running" (active gameplay), and "gameOver".
  - A countdown precedes the start of the game, and a restart option is available on the game over screen.

• Interactive Buttons:
  - On-screen buttons ("Play" and "Restart") are triggered via both mouse clicks and finger-based interaction.
  - A toggle button allows players to enable/disable bounding boxes for visual feedback.

• High Score Tracking:
  - The game keeps track of your high score across sessions.

• Responsive Design:
  - Built with p5.js, the canvas adjusts to your browser window.
  - Virtual coordinates ensure consistent gameplay across different screen sizes.

How It Works:
---------------
1. On the start screen, players use hand tracking to interact with the "Play" button and toggle bounding boxes.
2. A brief countdown signals the start of the game.
3. During gameplay, coins and bombs fall from the top. Use your hand (via webcam) to catch coins with the bucket.
4. Your score increases with every coin caught. Colliding with a bomb ends the game with a "Boom!" message.
5. After 30 seconds or upon a bomb collision, the game transitions to the game over screen, displaying your final score and high score.

File Structure:
---------------
index.html:
  - Contains the main HTML markup, styles, and p5.js integration.
sketch.js:
  - Implements game logic, including hand tracking, object movement, collision detection, and state management.
Assets:
  - bucket.png, coin.png, bomb.png – Images for the bucket, coins, and bombs.

Usage:
---------------
• Ensure your webcam is enabled and grant browser access.
• Open the game in a modern web browser.
• Follow the on-screen instructions to play and try to beat your high score.
